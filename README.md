## Flask Application Design for Expense Tracking

### HTML Files
1. **index.html:**
   - Home page of the application where users can view a summary of their expenses.
   - Contains a list of all expenses, categorized by date and type.
   - Provides links to add new expenses and view detailed reports.

2. **add_expense.html:**
   - Form page for adding new expenses to the database.
   - Fields for date, type, amount, and description of the expense.
   - Submit button to save the expense to the database.

3. **reports.html:**
   - Page for viewing detailed reports on expenses.
   - Allows users to filter expenses by date range, type, or amount.
   - Generates charts and graphs to visualize spending patterns.

### Routes

1. **Home Route:**
   - URL: /
   - Method: GET
   - Function: Displays the index.html page, showing the list of expenses.

2. **Add Expense Route:**
   - URL: /add_expense
   - Method: GET
   - Function: Displays the add_expense.html page, allowing users to enter new expenses.

3. **Save Expense Route:**
   - URL: /save_expense
   - Method: POST
   - Function: Receives form data from add_expense.html, validates it, and saves the expense to the database.

4. **Reports Route:**
   - URL: /reports
   - Method: GET
   - Function: Displays the reports.html page, allowing users to view detailed reports on expenses.

5. **Generate Report Route:**
   - URL: /generate_report
   - Method: POST
   - Function: Receives filter criteria from the reports.html page, generates a report, and displays it on the page.

### Additional Considerations
- **Database:**
  - The application requires a database to store expenses and generate reports.
  - The specific database used is not part of the design, allowing for flexibility in choice (e.g., SQLite, MySQL, PostgreSQL).

- **Styling and Layout:**
  - The design does not include specific details on styling or layout.
  - Developers can customize the appearance and structure of the application to meet their preferences and requirements.

- **Security Measures:**
  - The design does not address security measures such as authentication and authorization.
  - Developers should implement appropriate security measures to protect user data and prevent unauthorized access.

- **Deployment:**
  - The design does not specify a deployment method for the application.
  - Developers can choose a suitable deployment method based on their requirements (e.g., local server, cloud platform).
